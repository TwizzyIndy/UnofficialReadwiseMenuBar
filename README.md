# The Unofficial Readwise Highlight Menu Bar App
This is the unofficial Readwise Highlight Menu Bar for macOS which would fetch the saved highlights from your Readwise account and showing them on your mac desktop. I only made this for practise SwiftUI and it was my first ever SwiftUI app. Thanks everyone who made great menu bar apps and open-source them which described in References section.
